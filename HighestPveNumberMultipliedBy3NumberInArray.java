/*        I recently, appeared for second phone interview with CloudEra, the interviewer asked me to
        write a function which takes in an array of integers and returns the highest positive product
        possible by multiplying 3 distinct numbers. NO SORTING is ALLOWED

        PS: Please write a solution in JAVA or Python. (Not interviewer request)


        example:

        [1, 3, 5, 2, 8, 0, -1, 3]

        => 8 * 5 * 3 = 120*/


public class HighestPveNumberMultipliedBy3NumberInArray {

    public static void main(String args[]){
     int[] givenArray = {1, 3, 5, 2, 8, 0, -1, 3};
    }
}
